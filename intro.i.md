# Introduction

[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) is a useful resource in the linked data network [<cite>Q27042516</cite>].
The [Wikicite](http://wikicite.org/) project has picked up the challenge to enter all
scholarly publications (cited in Wikipedia) [<cite>Q28843308</cite>]. Inspired by
[Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/) [<cite>Q41799194</cite>], this electronic books collects
a number of queries useful to journal editors.
